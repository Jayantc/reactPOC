Guidelines :

 

1) Use ES6 while writing the code.

2) Create folder structure as taught in ReactJS session.
3) Breakdown the screen design into small components and try to create reusable components instead of writing the same code more than one time.
4) Use appropriate component lifecycle methods for API call.

5) Wherever require use React concepts like Refs, List, PropTypes, HOC’s, Fragments, Context API,
6) Try to use Hooks in functional component for State Management.
7) Try to avoid rendering extra Dom elements, use conditional rendering.
8) If we are building application responsive try to use Media query & Flex box CSS.
9) Use Error boundaries for displaying appropriate error messages to the end user.(Create reusable component/functionality for showing errors)
10) Use routing as taught in ReactJS session.
11) Integrate all API’s into React application, which you have created in past Sessions(MongoDB & Node JS)
